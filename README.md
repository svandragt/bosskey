## Description

**Boss Key** is a simple browser extension that allows you to quickly "exit the page" and navigate away from the current website using a keyboard shortcut or a toolbar button. 
It's perfect for those moments when you need to quickly switch to a different site without drawing attention. 

Itâ€™s intended to be a safety tool, inspired by the [gov.uk feature](https://beeps.website/blog/2024-10-09-why-govuk-exit-this-page-doesnt-use-escape/).
